# Medical-Inventory-Management
Imagine you're working in a hospital and suddenly realize that a life-saving medicine is out of stock — or worse, the available one has expired. Situations like these can be critical, and that’s exactly the problem we’re solving.

Our Medical Inventory Management System, built on Salesforce, helps hospitals and clinics manage their medical supplies more efficiently. Instead of relying on manual records or spreadsheets, our system keeps track of everything—stock levels, expiry dates, suppliers, and orders—in one place. It even sends alerts when a product is about to expire or when stock is running low.

With custom dashboards, automated workflows, and secure role-based access, healthcare staff can spend less time worrying about inventory and more time focusing on patient care. In short, we’re bringing safety, speed, and simplicity to medical inventory management.
